  "activityID" specifys "activity_name"(1 WALKING, 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4 SITTING, 5 STANDING, 6 LAYING).
  "subject" specifys each person(each person has original subject value).
  
  The others come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals timeAcc-XYZ and timeGyro-XYZ.
Time were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz(then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.).
Acceleration(Acc) signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAcc-XYZ and timeGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

  Body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroJerk-XYZ).
Magnitude(Mag) of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccMag, timeGravityAccMag, timeBodyAccJerkMag, timeBodyGyroMag, timeBodyGyroJerkMag). 

  Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyAcc-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccJerk-XYZ, frequencyBodyGyro-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccJerkMag, frequencyBodyGyroMag, frequencyBodyGyroJerkMag.

  XYZ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

  mean(): Mean value
  std(): Standard deviation
